# Linear_SVM
# Linear SVM  in this model we will build a linear SVM to detect the Iris Virginica flowers  
#importing the required libraries  import numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC #LinearSVC is a Suport vector clasifier  All the required Libraries are imported now we will import the data set  #loading the data from datasets iris = datasets.load_iris()  Now we got the data lets Lets make the feature variable and Target variable  X = iris['data'][:,(2,3)] # we are reading petal length and width y = (iris['target']==2).astype(np.float64) # those are only Virginica  pd.DataFrame(X).head()  pd.DataFrame(y).head()  we have set our feature variable and our target variable and we have seen how they look like  Lets build a pipeline for scaling and model Instatiation  svm_clf = Pipeline([     ('scaler' , StandardScaler()),     ('linear_svc', LinearSVC(C=1, loss = 'hinge')), ])  Lets fit our model  svm_clf.fit(X, y)  we have trained our model lets see its prediction  #we are giving the values of the first row in the X svm_clf.predict([[1.4, 0.2]])  we got the first row of y    # This is how an Linear SVM works...  Thank you
